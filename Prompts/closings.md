# Closing Patterns

How to end posts. The ending often makes or breaks engagement.

---

## Punchline Closings
Best for: Story posts, product reviews, observations

**Template:** "[thing] is the best [category] your [common comparison] could never be"

**Examples:**
- "[tool] is the best dev experience your enterprise vendor could never be"
- "[app] is the best assistant your coworker could never be"

**Why it works:** Elevates the subject by creating contrast with something relatable.

## Determination Closings
Best for: Series posts, goals, asks

**Templates:**
- "i won't stop until [specific goal]"
- "[community] i need your support"
- "shipping soon 🫡🫡"

---

## Question Closings
Best for: Build posts, observations, seeking engagement

**Templates:**
- "Am I missing something important? thoughts?"
- "is there a [X] going on right now??????"
- "@[founder1] and @[founder2] ?"

---

## Minimal Closings
Best for: Observations, jokes

- "lol"
- Single emoji (🫡 💀 😭)
- Nothing (let the content speak)

---

## Tag Closings
Best for: Build posts, sharing content about others

**Templates:**
- "follow @[person] @[person] for more"
- "@[relevant_founder] ?"

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ "Let me know what you think!" (too formal)
- ❌ "Like and RT if you agree!" (desperate)
- ❌ "Thread 🧵" at the start (okay) but don't overuse
- ❌ Multiple CTAs (pick one)
- ❌ Excessive emojis at the end
