# Phrase Patterns

Specific phrases, transitions, and structural patterns that work.

## Bullet List Prefixes
- "> " for escalating lists (story format)
- "- " for simple lists
- Each bullet should be able to stand alone as a hot take

## Escalation Pattern
Build from reasonable → absurd within a list:
1. Normal action (cleared emails)
2. Slightly impressive (booked flights)
3. Unexpected (installed dating app)
4. Absurd (matched with 4 people, planned dates)
5. Peak absurdity (told me what to say, gave life advice)

## Punchline Closings
- "[thing] is the best [category] your [common comparison] could never be"
- Format: Elevate the subject by dunking on a relatable comparison

## Determination Closings
- "i won't stop until [specific goal]"
- "CT i need your support"
- Community call-to-action works for series posts

## Definitive Statement Closings
- "There is no shortcut."
- "That's the only way."
- "No exceptions."
- Works because: quotable, shareable, ends with conviction
- Use after showing a process/journey — validates the grind

## Philosophical Zingers (Replies)
Short wisdom that reframes the conversation:
- "[You can] get it overnight, but you can't handle it."
- "[X] only works when you've earned [it] through experience."
- "Most overnight successes just have long Git histories."
- Structure: contrarian setup + earned insight
- Works because: adds depth without length

## Ultra-Condensed Summaries
Capture an entire thread in 2-4 words:
- "Compounding in public"
- "no shortcuts, just better tolerance for failure"
- Use as reply to show you got the point faster than others

## Casual Reactions
- "lmaooooo"
- "💀 💀 💀"
- One-word replies to funny comments keep engagement going

## Transitions (within posts)
- "in just [time]:" → then bullet list
- "at the end says," → for punchline delivery
- No transitions needed - just list things directly

> [action 4 - more absurd]
> [peak moment with quote]
[punchline comparing to relatable thing]
```

### Series Post
```
day X of [doing thing]
[brief context/justification]
[community call to action]
[determination statement] [single emoji]
[quote-tweet previous day]
```

### Listicle Post
```
[Number] [superlative] things on [topic]:
- [observation 1]

- [observation 3 - spiciest take last]
```

## Tone Markers
- **Lowercase always** - "i" not "I", no caps on sentences
- **Direct** - state things, don't hedge
- **Specific** - use real names, real numbers
- **Insider** - assume your audience gets the context
- **Brief** - one idea per bullet, no fluff
