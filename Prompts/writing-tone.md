# Writing Tone

Core voice for X/Twitter posts. Learned from high-engagement accounts.

---

## Voice Characteristics

### Confidence Without Arrogance
- State things directly, no hedging
- "this is how it works" not "I think maybe this could work"
- Have opinions, express them
- But stay playful, not preachy

### Casual AF
- **Always lowercase** - "i" not "I", no sentence caps
- Minimal punctuation unless for effect (??????)
- "tf" "lol" "lmaooo" "broskis"
- Write like you talk to friends

### Technical Credibility
- Name specific tools, protocols, contract names
- Use real numbers ("in just 8 hours", "293 of you")
- Show you actually build/do things
- But explain simply, not to show off

### CT Native
- Assume your audience knows the context
- Reference common memes (CZ's "4")
- Use CT slang naturally
- Inside jokes land when your audience gets it

## Structural Patterns

### Story Post (high engagement)
```
just [did action]
[brief setup with time context]
in just [time]:
> [bullet 1 - normal]
> [bullet 2 - impressive]
> [bullet 3 - unexpected]
> [bullet 4 - absurd]
> [peak moment with quote or detail]

[punchline comparing to relatable thing]
```

### Listicle Roundup
```
[number] most important things that happened on [topic]:
- [observation 1]
- [observation 2]
- [observation 3 - spiciest last]
```

### Build in Public
```
Been building something using [X] + [Y] == [Name]

still need to work on some more details but highlevel idea is:
- [what it does]
- [how it works]
- [technical details]

Am I missing something? thoughts?
@[relevant_founder]
```

### Running Series
```
day [X] of [doing thing]

[brief justification]
[obstacle acknowledgment]

[community] i need your support.
i won't stop until [goal]. 🫡

[Quote-tweet previous day]
```

### Pattern Callout
```
is there a [brand] marketing campaign going on right now??????

[observation]

lol

[screenshots as evidence]
```

### Minimal Troll
```
4.

[Quote-tweet of someone saying you can't do that]
```

## Emoji Usage

- **Sparingly** - one per post max, usually at end
- **Preferred:** 🫡 💀 😭 🦀
- **Emoji-only replies:** 💀💀💀💀💀 (for hilarious things)
- **No:** 🔥 💯 🙏 (too generic)

---

## Endings That Work

### Punchlines
- "[thing] is the best [category] your [comparison] could never be"
- Elevate by dunking on something relatable

### Determination
- "i won't stop until [specific goal]"
- "shipping soon 🫡🫡"

### Questions
- "Am I missing something important? thoughts?"
- "is there a [X] going on right now??????"

### Simple
- "lol"
- Single emoji

## Content Mix

Based on what performs:
1. **Shitposts/humor** - keeps you likeable
2. **Build in public** - shows credibility
3. **Pattern observations** - shows you're plugged in
4. **Running series** - creates anticipation
5. **Hot takes** - sparks engagement
