# Hook Patterns

Opening lines that grab attention.

---

## Simple Action Statement
Best for: Product/tool reviews, personal experiences, announcements
- "just installed [thing]"
- "just [did action]"
- "i did [thing] and left it alone. in just [time]:"
- Setup → then deliver with bullet escalation

## Running Series / Streak
Best for: Building narrative momentum, community engagement
- "day X of [doing thing]"
- Quote-tweet the previous day's post
- Works because: creates anticipation, shows persistence, each day is a new chance to go viral
- End with determination: "i won't stop until [goal]"

## Listicle Roundup
Best for: Commentary, news recap, observations
- "[Number] most important things that happened on [topic]:"
- "[Number] things [community] isn't talking about:"
- Delivery: simple dashes/bullets, each item a standalone hot take
- Mix: humor + insight + spicy prediction

## Contrarian / Hot Take
Best for: Sparking debate, showing expertise
- "Most [people/founders/devs] get this wrong..."
- "Unpopular opinion: [statement]"
- "[Common advice] is terrible advice."

## Curiosity Gap
Best for: Threads, learnings, reveals
- "I spent [time] doing [thing]. Here's what I learned:"
- "Nobody talks about this, but..."

## Myth-Busting / Attribution Story
Best for: Success stories, founder spotlights, behind-the-scenes
- "[Person/Thing] is not [common assumption]."
- "[Person] didn't get lucky. They [specific action with number]."
- Structure: Contrarian claim → specific number → bullet journey → definitive close
- Works because: challenges lazy narratives, gives actionable framework
- Example: "The founder of X is not lucky. He built 43 side projects to achieve success."

## Minimal Context / Troll
Best for: Inside jokes, proving a point, meta-humor
- Single number: "4."
- Reference something without explaining
- Quote-tweet someone saying "you can't do X" → do X
- Only works when you have engaged audience who gets it

## Build in Public
Best for: Shipping, getting feedback, engagement from founders
- "Been building something using both [X] + [Y] == [Name]"
- "still need to work on some more details but highlevel idea is:"
- End with: "Am I missing something important? thoughts?"
- Tag relevant founders/projects
- Include image/diagram

## Style Notes

- **Always lowercase** - no caps unless for emphasis
- **No hedging** - direct statements, confident
- **Specificity** - name actual tools, people, companies
- **CT insider language** - assume audience knows the context
- **Single emoji** at end if any (🫡 💀)
