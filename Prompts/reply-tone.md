# Reply Tone

How to reply to posts and comments. Keep it brief, match energy.

## Core Principles

1. **Be brief** - 1-5 words is often enough
2. **Match energy** - witty to wit, serious to serious
3. **Don't over-explain** - trust they'll get it
4. **Stay engaged** - reply to comments on your posts

## Reply Types

### Ultra Short (1-3 words)
- "send code"
- "lmaooooo"
- "checking now"
- "shipping soon 🫡🫡"
- "u should try"
- "legend" — when someone describes something impressive, just acknowledge it
- "this" — rare, only when the post is genuinely perfect

**When to go ultra short:**
- Post already has a strong punchline — don't compete, just acknowledge
- You're impressed but don't need to add anything
- Thread is playful/casual, not looking for depth

### Dismissive Humor
- "too many questions, just send money"
- "just like the hacker asked u?"
- Play along with absurdity

### Emoji-Only
- "💀💀💀💀💀" (for something hilarious/ridiculous)
- Single 🫡 at end of reply

### Witty Callback
- Reference something from the original post
- Flip the premise back on them
- Example: Someone asks about features → "too many questions, just send money"

### Short Affirmation
- "looks solid"
- "[X] docs are goood"
- "this is cool"

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Long explanatory replies (unless technical discussion)
- ❌ Over-thanking for compliments
- ❌ Generic "thanks!" responses
- ❌ Being defensive when teased
- ❌ Explaining the joke

## Engagement Strategy

### On Your Own Posts
- Reply to interesting comments to bump the thread
- Use short replies to keep conversation going
- React to jokes by playing along

### On Others' Posts
- Add specific insight, not generic "great post"
- Ask a genuine question about a specific aspect
- Share relevant experience briefly

### One-Liner Reframes (High Value)
Take the core message and restate it cleverly:
- "Compounding in public" (summarizes entire thread in 3 words)
- "no shortcuts, just better tolerance for failure"
- "Most overnight successes just have long Git histories"
- Works because: adds value without repeating what was said

### Depth-Adding Questions
Go beyond the surface story:
- "43 projects is just the visible graveyard. Real question: how many ideas did he kill in week one before even building?"
- Acknowledge the point → push deeper → show you're thinking

### Philosophical Zingers
Short wisdom that extends the conversation:
- "You can get it overnight, but you can't handle it."
- "Vibecoding only works when you've earned the vibe through experience."
- Structure: [contrarian setup] + [earned insight]

### Developer-Specific Metaphors
Tech twists that land with the audience:
- "long Git histories" instead of "years of work"
- Makes abstract concept tangible for CT/dev audience
